  - question: Do you think you or someone you know might be experiencing
      discrimination at school?
    selectLabel: Yes or No
    options:
      - option: Yes
        response: Discrimination means “unequal or different treatment or harassment
          that causes harm” (Human Rights Support Centre). Keep in mind that all
          negative behaviour is going to constitute discrimination. The
          treatment must be connected to a protected ground of discrimination
          (e.g. gender identity or gender expression).
      - option: No
        response: Great. I’m glad to hear that your school administrators are providing
          a learning environment free from discrimination.

          capacity. In case, you are curious, here is a great

          You should consider speaking with a lawyer to obtain legal advice. I
          can only provide general information about the human rights system in
          Ontario. Use our Resource Finder to access services, including some
          that are free or low-cost.


          An individual who believes they have experienced a human rights violation can file a complaint (called an application) directly to the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal. An individual typically has one year from the date of the last incident of discrimination to file their application. 


          The Human Rights Legal Support Centre (HRLSC) helps individuals who file applications to the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal. They may be able to provide individuals with advice, support, and legal representation.
