caseName: Mandziak v. Taste of Tuscany Ltd.
citation: 2017 AHRC 7
description: "The complainant alleged that during her employment she suffered
  discrimination in the form of sexual harassment. She states she was terminated
  after expressing her concerns about working alone with the owner. The HRT held
  that the respondent gave exaggerated and inconsistent evidence, whereas the
  complainant presented as a credible witness. The complainant's evidence was
  preferred, and the Tribunal held that section 7 of the Alberta Human Rights
  Act had been contravened. "
takeaway: Sexual harassment, in any form, constitutes discrimination on the
  basis of gender.
