isCornerstone: false
caseName: Jorden v. McBride and Moyer
citation: 2006 BCHRT 499
description: The complainant, a transgender woman, alleged that two employees of
  Vital Statistics Agency discriminated against her on the basis of sexual
  orientation in refusing to issue a birth certificate reflecting her gender as
  female. While the application raises significant issues under the Code, the
  case was dismissed because the complainant alleged discrimination on the basis
  of  "sexual orientation" rather than "sex", and the complaint should have been
  made against eh agency at large, not the individuals responsible for the Act's
  administration.
takeaway: This case highlights the importance of transgender individuals' access
  to legal documents that reflect their lived experience.
