caseName: GS v. Toronto Catholic District School Board
citation: 2020 HRTO 703
description: The applicant is a transgender child who wants the TCDSB to
  implement anti-discrimination and anti-harassment training for teachers. This
  application includes a request for anonymization, which was granted by the
  OHRT.
takeaway: "In this case, the OHRT recognizes that \"outing\" the applicant would
  subject them to stigma and prejudice based on their gender identity. It is in
  their best interest to remain anonymous. As a result, only the applicant's
  initials will be used instead of their name. "
