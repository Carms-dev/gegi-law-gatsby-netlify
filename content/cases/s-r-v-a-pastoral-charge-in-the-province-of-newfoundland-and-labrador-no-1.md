caseName: S.R. v. A Pastoral Charge in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador (No. 1)
citation: 2017 CanLII 149981 (NL HRC)
description: The complainant alleged that he was excluded from all Church
  activities due to his sexual orientation and use of inclusive language during
  his sermon. Witness testimony proved that the complainant's public disclosure
  of his sexual orientation was offensive to some of the congregation, and was a
  factor in his termination.  The tribunal found that the respondent had
  discriminated against the complainant on the basis of sexual orientation.
takeaway: "Religious beliefs do not justify discrimination against an individual
  on a ground protected by the Human Rights Code. "
