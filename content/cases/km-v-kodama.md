caseName: K.M. v. Kodama
citation: 2014 HRTO 526
description: The applicant alleges that the respondent, a urologist, made
  derogatory remarks to him during his appointment. The applicant filed a
  complaint with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, who found
  that there was a degree of miscommunication between the parties. The OHRT
  refused to dismiss the case and stated that it is not necessary for the
  applicant to prove that the respondent intentionally discriminated against
  him.
takeaway: This case is important because the Human Rights Tribunal stated that
  unintentional discrimination still constitutes discrimination under the Code.
