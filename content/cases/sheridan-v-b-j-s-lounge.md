isCornerstone: false
caseName: Sheridan v. B.J.'s Lounge
citation: 1998 BCHRT 17
description: The complainant alleged that she was discriminated against because
  of her sex. The complainant applied to the Tribunal to amend her complaint to
  allege discrimination based on "gender identity." The application was refused,
  as gender identity was not yet a protected ground under the Human Rights Code.
  However, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to do this.
takeaway: 'This case is important because it shows that, while the complainant
  was able to prove that she was discriminated against, she could not change the
  contents of her complaint because "gender identity" would not be a protected
  ground until 2017. '
