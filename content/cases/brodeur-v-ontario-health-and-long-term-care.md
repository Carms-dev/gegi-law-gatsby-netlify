caseName: Brodeur v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care)
citation: 2013 HRTO 1229
description: The primary issue, in this case, is the difference between how
  female and male transgender folks are treated in the provision of benefits.
  While breast removal is covered as a part of SRS (Sex Reassignment Surgery),
  breast augmentation is not. The applicant in this case argues seeks funding of
  medical procedures that, in their view, are essential to their gender
  identity. However, the OHRT held that breast augmentation is not equivalent to
  breast removal, and is not medically necessary for gender transition.
takeaway: This case is important because it shows how cosmetic procedures, like
  breast augmentation, are not considered medically necessary in the transition
  process. However, such a procedure may be necessary for an individual to avoid
  feelings of gender dysphoria, which was not discussed in the case at hand.
