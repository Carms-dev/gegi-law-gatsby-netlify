  House, a supportive recovery house for men. The complainant alleged that
  coming out caused disruption in the house and was asked to be discreet about
  their identity.  The complainant left the house and soon relapsed The Tribunal
  states that the respondent's conduct was a factor in the relapse. However, the
  complainant was ultimately unsuccessful as a result of a significant delay in
  filing the application. "
