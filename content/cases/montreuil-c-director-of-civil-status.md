caseName: Montreuil c. Director of Civil Status
citation: 2002 CanLII 41257 (QC CA)
description: In this case, the Registrar of Civil Status refused to change the
  appellant's name to her preferred name because she had not undergone surgery,
  and such a name change would be confusing for the general public. The
  Registrar argued that one's first name must announce their sex. The Tribunal
  held that the Registrar's argument does not stand in front of the use of
  neutral names. The Tribunal stated that a given name does not mislead, as
  one's sex can be determined through gender expression. Ultimately, the
  Tribunal ordered the Registrary to change the appellant's name, as her gender
  expression is traditionally feminine.
takeaway: It is important to read this case critically. The Tribunal does not
  acknowledge the existence of non-binary or intersex individuals who may not
  appear as traditionally masculine or feminine. One should not be expected to
  present a certain way because of their name.
