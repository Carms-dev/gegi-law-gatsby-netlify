caseName: S.B. Newfoundland and Labrador (Service)
citation: 2015 CanLII 153582 (NL HRC)
description: The complainant requested that Vital Statistics change her gender
  designation on her birth registration. Vital Statistics refused, arguing that
  individuals must undergo surgery before gender designations can be changed.
  The Tribunal held that by requiring surgery, Vital Statistics was
  discriminating against the complainant based on gender identity and gender
  expression.
takeaway: "This case is important as the Tribunal required Vital Statistics to
  cease requiring transgender individuals to have surgery before their sex
  designation on government documents could be changed. "
