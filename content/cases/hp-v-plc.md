isCornerstone: false
caseName: H.P. v. P.L.C.
citation: 2013 ONCJ 399
description: In this case, the applicant alleges that their co-parent is seeking
  to restrict the applicant from seeing their children because of their gender
  transition. However, the applicant has pleaded guilty to sexual assault. The
  OHRT held that it is clear that the co-parent is not seeking to deny access
  because the applicant has undergone a gender transition, but rather his
  behaviour and failure to seek access to the children earlier.
takeaway: This case is an important example of how unfair treatment does not
  necessarily constitute discrimination. Here, the mother did not deny the
  father access to their children because of his gender identity, but rather
  because of other underlying factors unrelated to the Code's protected grounds.
