isCornerstone: false
caseName: Kelly v. Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation
citation: 2015 CanLII 13864 (NS HRC)
description: The complainant alleged that she was held to a higher standard at
  work than her male co-workers. The Board of Inquiry found that the
  complainant's supervisors treated her differently than her male counterparts.
  This imposed an unfair burden on the complainant. The Board concluded that
  there was evidence of sex-based discrimination in this case.
takeaway: This case is important as it exemplifies that holding women to a
  higher standard of work than their male peers is sexist and discriminatory.
