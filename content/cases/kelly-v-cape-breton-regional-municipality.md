caseName: "Kelly v. Cape Breton Regional Municipality "
citation: 2016 CanLII 97515 (NS HRC)
description: The complainant alleged that her male co-workers were given
  promotion opportunities, while she was not. However, the respondent provided
  evidence that proved that the male coworkers had scored higher than the
  complainant on a promotional routine test. The employer had provided a fair
  process of obtaining a promotion, therefore, there was no discrimination and
  the case was dismissed.
takeaway: All individuals should be given the same tools necessary to excel,
  whether it be in the workforce or in schools--regardless of gender.
