caseName: Bryson v University of New Brunswick (No. 3)
citation: 83 CHRR 144
description: "The complainant, a varsity hockey player at the University of New
  Brunswick (\"UNB\"), argued that UNB discriminated against her and her team on
  the basis of sex when it cut the Women's Varsity Hockey Program. The Board of
  Inquiry found that gender was a factor in UNB's decision to eliminate the team
  and that UNB's women hockey players had been marginalized as a result. The
  Board held that UNB's discriminatory attitudes towards women's hockey
  perpetuated negative views about women's participation in varsity
  athletics.  The Board ordered UNB to reinstate the team and to ensure that
  equality among athletic programs was protected. "
takeaway: Eliminating a womenâ€™s sports team with no reasonable justification
  constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex.
