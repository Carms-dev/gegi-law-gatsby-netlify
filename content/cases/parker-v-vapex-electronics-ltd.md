isCornerstone: false
caseName: Parker v. Vapex Electronics Ltd.
citation: 2020 AHRC 32
description: The complainant alleges that the respondent terminated her
  employment after learning that she was pregnant. The complainant had never
  received any complaints about her performance. The Tribunal accepted the
  evidence given by the complainant that she was pregnant and suffered an
  adverse impact by being terminated from her employment. She has proven that
  the pregnancy was a factor in her termination, and therefore the complaint has
  merit.
takeaway: Terminating an employee because they are pregnant constitutes
  discrimination on the basis of gender.
