caseName: "Worley v. Ontario Cycling Association "
citation: 2016 HRTO 952
description: The applicant, a transgender woman, alleges that the policies of
  Ontario Cycling Associations, in accordance with the World Anti-Doping Code,
  are discriminatory. The Code prohibits exogenous androgens such as
  testosterone, which the applicant relies on to maintain her health and
  day-to-day functionality. The Ontario Human Rights Tribunal held that the
  applicant has a reasonable prospect of success.
takeaway: "This case is important as it shows how prohibiting hormones like
  testosterone in sporting events is discriminatory to transgender individuals
  who rely on those same hormones. "
