caseName: LaLonde v. Toronto East General Hospital
citation: 2012 HRTO 2153
description: The applicant contends that the respondent did not provide the
  staff training on “Transgendered Health Competency” that it confirmed it had
  provided. However, the respondent never confirmed with Rainbow Health that the
  training would be administered, therefore, there was no instance of
  discrimination.

  never actually confirmed does not constitute discrimination.
