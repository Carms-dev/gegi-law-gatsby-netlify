caseName: Forrester v Saliba
citation: Forrester v Saliba
description: Respondent askes the court to change the order of December 10, 1996
  to one of sole custody in favour of the respondent, on the grounds that there
  has been a material change in circumstances warranting a change.  The issue in
  this case is whether the fact that the applicant has been transgendering from
  male to female and the consequences that flowed from such change, constitute a
  sufficient material change of circumstance to warrant a change in the
  custodial arrangement
takeaway: "This case is important because it proves that a parent's gender
  transition does not necessarily impact their ability to effectively parent. "
