caseName: Forrester v. Saliba
citation: 2000 CanLII 28722
description: The primary issue of this case is whether the applicant's gender
  transition constituted a sufficient material change of circumstance that would
  warrant a change in their custodial arrangement with the respondent. The OHRT
  concluded that there was no such change in circumstance that would negatively
  impact the parties' children, and therefore their joint custody agreement
  stands.
takeaway: "This case is important because it proves that a parent's gender
  transition does not necessarily impact their ability to effectively parent. "
