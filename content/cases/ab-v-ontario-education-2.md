caseName: A.B. v. Ontario (Education)
citation: 2019 HRTO 685
description: This application concerns the respondent's repeal of the 2015 sex
  education curriculum and the reintroduction of the 2010 curriculum for the
  2018/2019 academic year. The OHRT held that the proof of the 2010 curriculum
  being discriminatory is unfounded because teachers are obligated under the
  Ontario Human Rights Code and Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to
  include LGBTQ+ students in their teaching.
takeaway: While the applicant was unsuccessful, this case is still important.
  Here, the OHRT affirmed that teachers must include LGBTQ+ students in their
  sexual education curriculum because the Human Rights Code and the Canadian
  Charter of Rights and Freedoms require them to.
