caseName: XY v Ontario (Government and Consumer Services)
citation: 2012 HRTO 726
description: Transgender woman challenged the Government of Ontario's
  requirement that to change your birth certificate, you must undergo what the
  government termed "transsexual surgery" that has to be confirmed by two
  doctors. While the applicant underwent gender reaffirming surgery herself, she
  felt that the government's requirement was invasive, insulting, and unfair to
  transgender folks to undergo surgery to have their sex designation on their
  identification match their gender identity.
takeaway: "It affirms the importance of self-identifying gender for legal purposes. "
