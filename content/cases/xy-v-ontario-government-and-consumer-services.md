caseName: XY v. Ontario (Government and Consumer Services)
citation: 2012 HRTO 726
description: A transgender woman challenged the Government of Ontario's
  requirement that to change your birth certificate, you must undergo what the
  government termed "transsexual surgery" that has to be confirmed by two
  doctors. The applicant felt that the government's requirement was invasive,
  insulting, and unfair to transgender individuals. The OHRT agreed with the
  applicant and stated that the government had not established evidence that the
  surgery requirement is necessary.
takeaway: "It affirms the importance of self-identifying gender for legal purposes. "
