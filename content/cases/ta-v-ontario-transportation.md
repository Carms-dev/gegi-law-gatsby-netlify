caseName: T.A. v. Ontario (Transportation)
citation: 2016 HRTO 17
description: The applicant alleges discrimination through the use of binary
  gender markers on government documents requested by the respondent.  The
  respondent requested all records relating to sex designation and while the
  applicant did not consent, the OHRT deemed them necessary for the confirmation
  of the applicant's identity.
takeaway: While this case was unsuccessful, it is important as the applicant
  addresses whether or not traditional binary gender markers are necessary on
  government documents.
