isCornerstone: false
caseName: TA v Ontario (Transportation)
citation: 2016 HRTO 17
description: The applicant identifies as pan-gendered and uses gender-neutral
  pronouns. The applicant alleges discrimination through the use of binary
  gender markers on government documents. The OHRT states that there is a nexus
  between the information that is sought by the respondent and the issue to be
  determined regarding the applicant’s assertion of fluid non-binary identity as
  a lived experience. For this reason, the respondent’s modified request for
  medical records disclosure relating to the assessment of gender identity is
  granted.
takeaway: While this case was unsuccessful, it is important as the applicant
  addresses whether or not traditional binary gender markers are necessary on
  government documents.
