caseName: Vanderputten v. Seydaco Packaging Corp.
citation: 2012 HRTO 1977
description: The applicant alleges that she was harassed, subjected to a
  poisoned work environment, and dismissed in violation of the Human Rights
  Code. However, she did not address her concerns for fear of being rejected by
  the respondent. The OHRT accepted the applicants' evidence and awarded her
  damages.
takeaway: This case is important as it highlights how an applicant does not
  necessarily need to address the harassment themselves, especially if they know
  it will be taken poorly by the harasser.
