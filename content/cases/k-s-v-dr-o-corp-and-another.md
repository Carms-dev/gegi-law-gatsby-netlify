caseName: K.S. v. Dr. O Corp. and Another
citation: 2018 BCHRT 273
description: The complainant, a transgender woman undergoing transition, filed a
  complaint against her respondent psychiatrist, alleging that the respondent
  refused to accept her as an ongoing patient and failed to refer her to another
  psychiatrist because of her transgender identity. The respondents stated that
  he lacked experience and training and was not qualified to provide ongoing
  care to the complainant, and therefore the complaint was dismissed. The
  complainant had no reasonable prospect of establishing that her gender
  identity was a factor in the respondent's failure to refer the complainant to
  another psychiatrist.
takeaway: A health care provider is allowed to refuse care to a transgender
  patient if they do not have adequate experience or training in transgender
  care.
