caseName: Burton v. Unifor Local 2003E
citation: 2018 HRTO 276
description: The applicant alleges that her local and national union
  discriminated against her in ignoring her requests for help and in failing to
  represent her interests. She further alleges that the local union
  “misgendered” her. The union requested that they be removed from the
  application, but the OHRT held that there was discrimination, and therefore
  the union cannot be removed.
takeaway: This case affirms that misgendering constitutes discrimination.
