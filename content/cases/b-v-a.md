caseName: B v A
citation: 1990 CanLII 7012 (ON SC)
description: The primary question of this case is whether a transgender man
  falls within the definition of a "spouse" in section 29 of the Family Law Act,
  1986. The OHRT held that gender-affirming surgery was, at the time, required
  for a person to have their gender marker changed on legal documents.
takeaway: Historically, surgery was required in order for transgender folks to
  identify as their true gender. In this case, the transgender male applicant
  did not have gender-affirming surgery and therefore, their correct gender was
  not recognized under the law.
