caseName: B v A
citation: 1990 CanLII 7012 (ON SC)
description: ' Whether originally female transsexual "man" within definition of
  spouse in s. 29 of Family Law Act, 1986'
takeaway: Historically, surgery was required in order for transgender folks to
  identify as their true gender. In this case, the transgender female applicant
  did not have gender affirming surgery and therefore was recognized as a man
  under the law.
