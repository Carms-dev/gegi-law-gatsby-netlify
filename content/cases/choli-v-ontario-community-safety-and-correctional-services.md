  officers refused to recognize her gender identity and expression and
  interacted with her as if she was a man. She was incarcerated in an all-male
  institution. The respondents raised concerns regarding the applicant's delay
  in submitting the application. The OHRT held that there was a connection
  between the incidents that creates a series of incidents, and therefore, the
  allegation is not dismissed.
