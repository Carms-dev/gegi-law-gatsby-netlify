caseName: Forrester v Peel (Regional Municipality) Police Services Board et al.
citation: 2006 HRTO 13
description: The complainant, a transgender woman, was subject to unjust strip
  searches by male police officers, despite asking for a female officer to
  conduct the search. The OHRT held that all police officers are obligated to
  act in accordance with the Ontario Human Rights Code with respect to strip
  searches.
takeaway: This case is important as it outlines the proper procedure for strip
  searches for transgender folks. Transgender folks ought to be offered options
  for who will be performing their strip search, the officer will then be
  required to explain the process and ask a set of questions if the detainee is
  showing any signs of doubt.
