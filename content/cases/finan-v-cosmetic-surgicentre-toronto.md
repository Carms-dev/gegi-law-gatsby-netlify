caseName: Finan v. Cosmetic Surgicentre (Toronto)
citation: 2008 HRTO 47
description: In this case, a surgeon at Toronto's Cosmetic Surgicentre refused
  to perform surgery on transgender patients. The OHRT held that this was not
  discriminatory, as the doctor was not qualified to offer the services that the
  applicant wanted.
takeaway: Refusing to perform surgery on a transgender individual solely because
  they are transgender is discrimination. In this case, however, the doctor was
  not qualified to offer the service the applicant wanted, so there was no
  discrimination.
