isCornerstone: false
caseName: Magnone v. British Columbia Ferry Services and Others (No. 3)
citation: 2008 BCHRT 191
description: The complainant, a transgender woman, argues that she was fired
  because her employers knew that she was transgender. Through witness
  testimony, the Tribunal held that the complainant was not suitable for the
  position, and that is why she was terminated (not because of her gender).
takeaway: It is discrimination to deny someone a position because of their
  gender. However, in this case, the respondents were able to justify the
  termination on grounds that had nothing to do with her identity.
