caseName: Skeffington v. Alberta (Human Rights and Citizenship Commission)
citation: 2006 ABQB 776
description: In this case, the Applicant alleges that she was refused employment
  by Edmonton Northlands because she is transgender. However, the applicant's
  preferred name was placed on a 'no-hire list due to negative comments directed
  towards the company. The application was dismissed, and the Tribunal held that
  the applicant was not mistreated in the hiring process.
takeaway: In this case, there was no discrimination on the basis of gender or
  sex. Rather, the applicant had publicly made negative statements about the
  company and was subsequently placed on a 'no-hire list.
