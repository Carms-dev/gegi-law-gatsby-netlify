isCornerstone: false
caseName: McPherson v. 557466 Alberta Ltd. o/a LDV Pizza Bar
citation: 2020 AHRC 83
description: "The complainant alleges that the respondent changed her shift
  schedules and terminated her employment after learning that she was pregnant.
  The complainant was adversely dealt with on the basis of gender, which
  included a change in the length and timing of shifts and termination of
  employment. The pregnancy was a factor in leading to the adverse impact as the
  adverse treatment only began after the pregnancy announcement. The respondents
  did not make any accommodations for the complainant and the respondent was not
  justified in taking the actions it did. "
takeaway: Mistreating an individual because they are pregnant constitutes
  discrimination on the basis of gender.
