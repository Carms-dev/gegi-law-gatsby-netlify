caseName: McPherson v. 557466 Alberta Ltd. o/a LDV Pizza Bar
citation: 2020 AHRC 83
description: The complainant alleged that the respondent changed her shift
  schedules and terminated her employment after learning that she was pregnant.
  The pregnancy was a factor in leading to the adverse impact as the adverse
  treatment only began after the pregnancy announcement. The Tribunal held that
  the respondents did not make any accommodations for the complainant and was
  not justified in terminating her employment.
takeaway: Mistreating an individual because they are pregnant constitutes
  discrimination on the basis of gender.
