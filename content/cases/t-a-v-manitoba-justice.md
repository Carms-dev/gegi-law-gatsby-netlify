caseName: T.A. v. Manitoba (Justice)
citation: 2019 MBHR 12
description: 'The complainant alleged that the government of Manitoba
  discriminated against them by not providing them with a gender congruent birth
  certificate. The complainant does not identify with "male" or "female," and
  wished to have the gender marker changed to "X." The Tribunal stated that
  strict male/female gender markers expose non-binary individuals to
  unjustifiable undue hardship. The tribunal held that the respondent
  discriminated against the complainant. '
takeaway: T.A. is the first adjudication in Manitoba on the ground of gender
  identity. This particular decision is important as Manitoba Vital Statistics
  was ordered to revise the criteria for changing sex designation to include the
  recognition of non-binary individuals, therefore expanding the list of gender
  markers beyond the male/female binary.
