caseName: D.B. v. Toronto District School Board
citation: 2015 HRTO 1592
description: This case deals with several incidents relating to a minor. In
  grade 2, the complainant asked his teacher to refer to him as "Happy Face",
  and she complied. The complainant proceeded to express feelings of gender
  dysphoria that persisted through grades 3 and 4, during which he transitioned.
  Given the scope of the application, the respondent requested that the
  application be limited. The OHRT granted the respondent's request, as the
  incidents are distinct in character.
takeaway: This case is important as it outlines how school boards ought to take
  proper steps to ensure that their students gender identity is supported and
  vulnerabilities (like potential exposure to ridicule and bullying) are
  eliminated,
