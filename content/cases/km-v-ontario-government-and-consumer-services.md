caseName: K.M. v. Ontario (Government and Consumer Services)
citation: 2015 HRTO 434
description: The applicant identified as a transgender male. The applicant
  submitted a request for anonymization, which was granted by the OHRT.
takeaway: "In this case, the OHRT recognizes that \"outing\" the applicant would
  subject them to stigma and prejudice based on their gender identity. It is in
  their best interest to remain anonymous. As a result, only the applicant's
  initials will be used instead of their name. "
