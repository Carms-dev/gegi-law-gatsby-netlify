caseName: Hosu v. University of Calgary
citation: Hosu v. University of Calgary
description: The complainant is a certified national gymnastics coach. When the
  Women's Competitive Head Coach left, several men with no qualifications were
  given positions. The complainant alleges that she was discriminated against on
  the basis of gender by not being considered for the Head Coach position and by
  being paid less than her less qualified, male colleagues. The matter will
  proceed to a Tribunal hearing.
takeaway: Mistreating an individual because they are pregnant constitutes
  discrimination on the basis of gender.
