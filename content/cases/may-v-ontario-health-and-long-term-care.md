isCornerstone: false
caseName: May v Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care)
citation: 2011 HRTO 2179
description: The issue, in this case, is whether it is an abuse of process to
  relitigate the delisting of sex reassignment surgery in 1998 as an insured
  service under OHIP in light of the Tribunalâ€™s Decision in Hogan v. Ontario
  (Health and Long Term Care). The OHRT cannot act as an appellate body, and
  therefore, it would be an abuse of process to relitigate.
takeaway: This case is important because it affirms that the Human Rights
  Tribunal cannot act as an appellate body over prior decisions.
