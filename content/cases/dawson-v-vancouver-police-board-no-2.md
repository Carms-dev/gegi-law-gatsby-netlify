isCornerstone: false
caseName: Dawson v. Vancouver Police Board (No. 2)
citation: 2015 BCHRT 54
description: The complainant, a transgender woman, alleged that police officers
  have refused to recognize her as a woman and refused her access to proper
  medical care relating to preexisting conditions. The police officers were
  obligated to provide a service but failed to provide it in a
  non-discriminatory manner. The officers did not recognize the complainant's
  particular needs and therefore discriminated against her.
takeaway: In this case, the complainant and the Tribunal argue that the lack of
  policies and training provided to officers is part of a systemic failure to
  ensure that trans individuals are not discriminated against by the Vancouver
  Police Board.
