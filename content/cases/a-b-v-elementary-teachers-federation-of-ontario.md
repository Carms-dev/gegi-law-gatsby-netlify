caseName: A.B. v. Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario
citation: 2018 HRTO 1224
description: The applicant alleges that the respondents refused to address him
  by his proper name and gender, and requests anonymization. The OHRT granted
  their request, but the application was ultimately dismissed as having no
  reasonable prospect of success.
takeaway: "In this case, the OHRT recognizes that \"outing\" the applicant would
  subject her to stigma and prejudice based on her gender identity. It is in her
  best interest to remain anonymous. As a result, only the applicant's initials
  will be used instead of her name. "
