caseName: Corren v. Abbotsford School Board
citation: 2010 BCHRT 32
description: The complainants, on behalf of the students and parents of the
  Abbotsford School District and in particular LGBTQIA+ students, filed a
  complaint in which they alleged that the School District's curriculum
  discriminated against LGBTQIA+ individuals by failing to include any
  information about the community.  The School District attempted to make
  changes to the curriculum, but due to negative backlash withdrew the course
  entirely. However, the Tribunal held that the complaint had to be amended
  because it is too broad.
takeaway: "This case is important because it highlights the importance of
  including sexual orientation and sexual identity into school curriculums. "
