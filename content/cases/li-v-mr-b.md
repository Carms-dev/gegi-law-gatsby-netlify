citation: 2018 BCHRT 228
description: The complainant alleges that he rented a suite in the home of the
  respondent and his partner. The complainant states that there were
  difficulties in their relationship as landlord and tenant, which resulted in
  the complainant ending the lease. The respondent, in return, threatened the
  complainant and showed the complainant's employers photographs of the
  complainant in a dress. The Tribunal held that the respondent did intend to
  discriminate against the complainant based on gender identity and expression.
  The respondent intended to cause an adverse effect on the complainant's
  employment.

  constitutes discrimination of a protected ground.
