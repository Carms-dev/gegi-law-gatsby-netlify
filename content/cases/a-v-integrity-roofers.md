caseName: A. v. Integrity Roofers
citation: 2017 HRTO 919
description: The applicant alleges that she was subjected to discriminatory
  treatment when she attended a job interview. The applicant requests that the
  application be anonymized, which the OHRT granted.
takeaway: "In this case, the OHRT recognizes that \"outing\" the applicant would
  subject them to stigma and prejudice based on their gender identity. It is in
  their best interest to remain anonymous. As a result, only the applicant's
  initials will be used instead of their name. "
