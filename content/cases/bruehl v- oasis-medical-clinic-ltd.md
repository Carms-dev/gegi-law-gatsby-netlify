isCornerstone: false
caseName: Bruehl v. Oasis Medical Clinic Ltd.
citation: 2016 AHRC 15
description: In this preliminary meeting, the complainant alleged that the
  respondent discriminated against her on the grounds of gender in the form of
  sexual harassment, contrary to section 7 of the Alberta Human Rights Act. She
  argues that she was harassed by the respondent, and subsequently terminated on
  a false pretext in order to protect him. The complaint will go on to be heard
  by the Tribunal.
takeaway: Respondents in a discrimination case do not necessarily have to
  directly discriminate against the complainant. As in this case, two of the
  three respondents were not alleged to initiate the discrimination, but rather
  make the incident worse by terminating the complainant on false pretenses.
