caseName: Centre for Gender Advocacy c. Quebec (Attorney General)
citation: 2015 QCCS 6026
description: The plaintiffs in this case successfully argued that several
  articles of the Civil Code of Quebec result in the exclusion, prejudice, and
  discrimination of transgender and intersex individuals under the Canadian
  Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms.
takeaway: "This is a foundational case as the Court stated that binary gender
  identification is unconstitutional. Additionally, the Court held that trans
  parents are able to change their gender on their children's birth certificate,
  and have the gender-neutral option of being recognized as a \"parent\" rather
  than a \"mother\" or \"father\". Finally, the Court struck down the
  requirement that an individual must be a Canadian citizen to undergo a name or
  gender change on official documents. "
