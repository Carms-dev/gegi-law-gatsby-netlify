caseName: Cameron v. Hamilton Black History Committee
citation: 2016 HRTO 541
description: "Complainant alleges that the respondent rejected her request to
  establish a scholarship for Black lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender youth
  at its 2015 ceremony, but had a historical practice of accepting such requests
  from others whose identity and proposed scholarship was not tied to sexual
  orientation and gender identity.  "
takeaway: This case is important because it shows how a school was willing to
  create scholarships for minority identities except those relating to sexual
  orientation and gender identity. The respondent's refusal to establish a
  scholarship for black LGBTQ+ youth was discriminatory.
