caseName: Greater St. Albert Roman Catholic Separate School, District No. 735 v. Buterman
citation: 2013 ABQB 485
description: The transgender complainant filed a discrimination complaint
  because the Catholic  School Board removed his name from the substitute
  teacher list. The Deputy Superintendant stated that the complainant's gender
  was not aligned with the teachings of the Church and he would create confusion
  and complexity with students and parents as a model and witness to Catholic
  faith values. He explicitly stated that according to the teachings of the
  Church, one cannot change their gender. The case was initially dismissed, but
  the Chief of Commission and Tribunals said that the complaint should not have
  been dismissed and referred it to the Human Rights Tribunal.
takeaway: This case shows how one's religious beliefs cannot justify
  gender-based discrimination. LGBTQ+ individuals have a right to work in
  Catholic schools.
