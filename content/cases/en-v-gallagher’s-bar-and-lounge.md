caseName: EN v. Gallagherâ€™s Bar and Lounge
citation: 2021 HRTO 240
description: Applicants (employees of Gallagher's) allege that they asked JG to
  use their correct pronouns, but JG dismissed them and continued to misgender
  them. JG was heard using slurs towards his employees. Anonymization request.
takeaway: This case, like many others, shows that consistently misusing gender
  pronouns and using slurs, even behind someone's back, is a direct violation of
  the Human Rights Code.
