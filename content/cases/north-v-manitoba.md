caseName: North v. Manitoba
citation: 2018 MBHR 1
description: "The complainant, a gay man, wished to marry his partner in 1974.
  At this time, Manitoba law did not allow individuals of the same sex to apply
  for a marriage licence. After the legalization of same-sex marriage, the
  complainant alleged that Manitoba had discriminated against him when it
  refused, and continues to refuse, to register his marriage. However, human
  rights adjudicators do not have the ability to change a past decision. As a
  result, the decision made prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage
  holds. "
