caseName: A.B. v. Mad Wax Windsor Inc.
citation: 2020 HRTO 407
description: The transgender applicant sought waxing services and was refused
  because the only person working at the time was a Muslim woman. The applicant
  requests anonymization, which the OHRT granted.
takeaway: "In this case, the OHRT recognizes that \"outing\" the applicant would
  subject her to stigma and prejudice based on her gender identity. It is in her
  best interest to remain anonymous. As a result, only the applicant's initials
  will be used instead of her name. "
