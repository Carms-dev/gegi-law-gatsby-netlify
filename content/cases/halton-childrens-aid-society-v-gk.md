caseName: Halton Children's Aid Society v. G.K.
citation: 2015 ONCJ 307
description: The Children's Aid Society brought a motion seeking that the
  children be placed in temporary care and custody of the father. CAS subjects
  that the mother may be forcing her eldest son to be a girl against his wishes.
  The OHRT found sufficient evidence of emotional harm brought on by the
  parents. The Tribunal states that the child has the right to express himself
  the way he chooses and it is hoped that each parent will accept, respect and
  support him through his development.
takeaway: This case is important as it highlights how children have the right to
  freely express themselves in whichever way they choose.  Parents are
  encouraged to accept and respect their children's decisions.
