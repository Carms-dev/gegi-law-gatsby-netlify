caseName: Â A.B. v. Ontario (Education)
citation: 2018 HRTO 1746
description: The applicant, an 11-year-old transgender child, submitted a
  publication ban and anonymization request. The OHRT granted their request.
takeaway: "In this case, the OHRT recognizes that \"outing\" the applicant would
  subject them to stigma and prejudice based on their gender identity. It is in
  their best interest to remain anonymous. As a result, only the applicant's
  initials will be used instead of their name. "
