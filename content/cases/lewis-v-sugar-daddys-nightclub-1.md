caseName: Lewis v Sugar Daddys Nightclub
citation: 2016 HRTO 793
description: The applicant (transgender neutral questioning transgender male)
  subject to adverse treatment when attempting to use the male washroom. The
  respondent requested reconsideration. The OHRT refused to reconsider.
takeaway: This case, among a multitude of others, is important as it shows that
  transgender folks ought to be able to use whatever washroom that aligns with
  their gender identity. Refusing to let someone use their preferred washroom
  constitutes discrimination under the Code.
