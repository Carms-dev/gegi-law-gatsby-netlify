caseName: C.F. v. Alberta (Vital Statistics)
citation: 2014 ABQB 237
description: "The complainant, a transgender woman, alleges that the Director of
  Vital Statistics violated her right to equal protection and benefit under
  section 15 of the Charter by refusing to change her sex designation on her
  birth certificate. In this case, the discrimination results from the
  requirement to undergo surgery in order to change the gender designation. The
  Tribunal found that the surgery requirement violated the complainant's right
  to equality. "
takeaway: This case highlights the importance of transgender individual's access
  to legal documents that reflect their lived experience. Additionally, it shows
  how Alberta's birth registration system (where only two genders, male and
  female, are recognized) greatly contributes to the discrimination of
  transgender individuals. C.F. kickstarted many legal reforms Canada-wide
  regarding trans people's access to identity documents.
