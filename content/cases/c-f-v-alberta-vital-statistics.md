caseName: C.F. v. Alberta (Vital Statistics)
citation: 2014 ABQB 237
description: The complainant, a transgender woman, alleges that the Director of
  Vital Statistics violated her right to equal protection and benefit under
  section 15 of the Charter by refusing to change her sex designation on her
  birth certificate. In this case, the discrimination results from the birth
  registration system not recognizing or accommodating the fact that the
  complainant has transitioned and is now female. The Tribunal held that Vital
  Statistics infringed on the complainant's right to equal protection and
  benefit of the law.
takeaway: This case highlights the importance of transgender individual's access
  to legal documents that reflect their lived experience. Additionally, it shows
  how Alberta's birth registration system (where only two genders, male and
  female, are recognized) greatly contributes to the discrimination of
  transgender individuals.
