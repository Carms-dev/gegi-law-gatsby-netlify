caseName: Sanderson v. Best Buy Canada
citation: 2016 HRTO 468
description: The applicant alleges that he was subject to a poisoned work
  environment. The main issue is whether the application should be dismissed if
  there is not a reasonable prospect that the application will succeed. The OHRT
  held that it is premature to dismiss the application, as the series of
  incidents described by the applicant appears to be capable of describing a
  series of events within the meaning of the Ontario Human Rights Code.
