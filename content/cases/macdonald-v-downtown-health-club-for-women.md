caseName: Macdonald v. Downtown Health Club for Women
citation: 2009 HRTO 1043
description: The applicant, a transgender woman, had requested access to a
  women-only fitness centre and was refused admission because she had not
  undergone surgery. The respondent requested medical records from the
  applicant's physician to prove that the applicant was planning to undergo
  surgery.
takeaway: This case illustrates how transgender folks could not enter into a
  gender-segregated facility without proving their intention to undergo surgery,
