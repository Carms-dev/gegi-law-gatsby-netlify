caseName: Sheridan v. Sanctuary Investments
citation: 1999 BCHRT 4
description: The complainant is a transgender woman who underwent
  gender-affirming surgery. She alleged that she was told she could not use the
  women's washroom and later refused access to the respondent's establishment as
  the bouncer refused to accept her identification. The Tribunal held that the
  respondent had a duty to accommodate transgender individuals with regard to
  washroom use.  Ultimately, the Tribunal stated that the respondent's actions
  were discriminatory on the basis of sex.
takeaway: This case is important as it affirms that transgender folks ought to
  have full access to their desired public washroom, whether or not they have
  undergone surgery.
