caseName: N.M. v. Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre
citation: 2018 HRTO 127
description: The applicant submitted a request to be anonymized in future
  proceedings. The OHRT granted their request.
takeaway: "In this case, the OHRT recognizes that \"outing\" the applicant would
  subject them to stigma and prejudice based on their gender identity. It is in
  their best interest to remain anonymous. As a result, only the applicant's
  initials will be used instead of their name. "
