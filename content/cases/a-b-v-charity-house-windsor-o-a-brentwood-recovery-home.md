isCornerstone: false
caseName: A.B. v. Charity House (Windsor) o/a Brentwood Recovery Home
citation: 2018 HRTO 1607
description: The applicant alleges that Brentwood had 90 days to develop
  policies and procedures to address the Ontario Human Rights Code rights in
  relation to LGBTQ+ folks and failed to do so. The applicant requested
  anonymization. The OHRT held that Brentwood breached their settlement
  agreement and granted the anonymization request.
takeaway: "In this case, the OHRT recognizes that \"outing\" the applicant would
  subject them to stigma and prejudice based on their gender identity. It is in
  their best interest to remain anonymous. As a result, only the applicant's
  initials will be used instead of their name. "
