caseName: Oger v. Whatcott (No. 7)
citation: 2019 BCHRT 58
description: Morgane Oger ran for the provincial election as an NDP candidate.
  Christian activist, William Whatcott, became concerned with Ogerâ€™s lobbying
  for amendments to the Code to add the grounds of gender expression and
  identity, and in promoting education about sexual orientation and identity in
  schools. The Tribunal ruled that Whatcott discriminated against Oger by
  distributing a Flyer entitled "Transgenderism vs. Truth" when Oger was running
  as the NDP candidate. The Tribunal found that Mr. Whatcott's Flyer was meant
  to discriminate against Oger because of her gender identity.
takeaway: This case shows that hate speech is not protected under the ground of
  freedom of speech or freedom of religion.
