caseName: Salsman v London Sales Arena Corp.
citation: 2014 HRTO 775
description: >-
  "Three transgender complainants were staffing Clarke-McIlwain’s Candy booth at
  the market Trails end owned by London Sales Arena Corp.  


  Rent collector/Manager and the Owner of the market were displeased with these three tending the booth. The reasons for this displeasure is disputed.  Respondents allege that it was because the applicants lit incense at the booth and were scantily and inappropriately dressed. Applicants allege that it was because they are transgendered. After the incident, Mr. Kikkert (owner) went on a radio show and talked about the market being a “family market”; the fact that he did not have washroom facilities for “these people”; and he referred to the applicants as “people like that”"
takeaway: It affirms that transgender folks ought to have full access to their
  desired public washroom, whether or not they have undergone surgery.
