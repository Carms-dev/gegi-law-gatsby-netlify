caseName: JV v. Ontario (Health Insurance Plan)
citation: 2009 CanLII 84982
description: "The appellant, a transgender woman, was approved for Sex
  Reassignment Surgery (SRS), and it was deemed medically necessary by her
  physicians. The appellant underwent SRS and subsequently sought reimbursement
  for the costs from OHIP, which they denied. The appeal was denied because SRS
  is an uninsured service. "
takeaway: This case is important as it shows that SRS is not covered under OHIP,
  despite being deemed medically necessary.
