caseName: Nelson v. Goodberry Restaurant Group Ltd. dba Buono Osteria and others
citation: 2021 BCHRT 137
description: The complainant is a non-binary, gender fluid, transgender person
  who uses they/them pronouns. Throughout their employment, their co-worker
  consistently misgendered them and referred to them with degrading and
  offensive nicknames that erased their gender identity. The employers refused
  to take action and eventually terminated the complainant. The BCHRT held that
  the complainant was discriminated against by the respondents, contrary to s.13
  of the Code.
takeaway: This case shows how the Human Rights Code protects individuals from
  being misgendered.
