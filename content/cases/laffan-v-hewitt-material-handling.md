isCornerstone: false
caseName: "Laffan v. Hewitt Material Handling "
citation: 2017 HRTO 619
description: The applicant alleges that she has been discriminated against in
  her workplace. She requested that the grounds of gender identity and gender
  expression be removed in her application, which the OHRT approved.
takeaway: This case is important as the applicant requested that the Tribunal
  remove the grounds of gender expression and gender identity, as she did not
  believe that she was being discriminated on those grounds. Discrimination in
  itself does not necessarily equate to discrimination on the basis of gender.
