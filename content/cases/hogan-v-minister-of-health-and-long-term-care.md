caseName: Hogan v Minister of Health and Long-Term Care
citation: 2006 HRTO 32
description: The primary issue, in this case, is whether the Government of
  Ontario was discriminating against transgender individuals by delisting Sex
  Reassignment Surgery (SRS). The OHRT held that delisting SRS was not, in
  itself, discriminatory.
takeaway: During Hogan "Gender Identity Disorder" was viewed as a disability,
  where individuals would then be recommended by a physician (with a 90%
  rejection rate) to undergo SRS. In this case, the province of Ontario delisted
  SRS, meaning that the surgery would not be covered by OHIP, which only
  exacerbated the difficulty of accessing gender-affirming healthcare for
  transgender individuals.
