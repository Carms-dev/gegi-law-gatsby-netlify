caseName: Nolting v. 847012 Alberta Ltd. (Prime West Contracting)
citation: 2017 AHRC 12
description: "The complainant alleges that the respondent refused to hire her
  because of her gender. She states that after submitting her application, the
  respondent called her and asked her to confirm her gender and stated that he
  was not looking to hire a woman. The Tribunal stated that gender is a
  protected characteristic. Additionally, the Tribunal held that the complainant
  experienced an adverse impact because of her gender as she was not selected
  for the job. Her gender was the deciding factor in whether or not she was
  hired. The complainant did not prove that he was unable to accommodate the
  complainant's gender and therefore discriminated against the complainant. "
takeaway: " It is discriminatory to deny someone a position because of their
  gender. Every person should be given equal opportunities to grow, whether it
  be in the workplace or at school, regardless of their gender."
