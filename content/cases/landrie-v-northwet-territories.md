caseName: Landrie v. Northwest Territories
citation: 2013 CanLII 148584 (NT HRAP)
description: The complainant alleged that the respondent denied her goods,
  services, accommodation or facilities because she is transgender. She was
  asked to move out of the hallway as the Governor-General and his security
  staff walked through the school. However, through witness testimony, the
  Tribunal held that she was not asked to move because of her gender identity,
  but rather because of a bona fide security concern.
