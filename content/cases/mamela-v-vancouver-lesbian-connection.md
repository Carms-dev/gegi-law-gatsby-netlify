caseName: Mamela v. Vancouver Lesbian Connection
citation: 36 CHRR 318
description: 'The complainant, a transgender woman, alleged that the Vancouver
  Lesbian Connection ("VLC") discriminated against her on the grounds of sex by
  suspending her membership for a year and prohibiting her from attending
  events. The complainant outlined several instances where the VLC deliberately
  misgendered the complainant and used her deadname. The Tribunal ultimately
  held that the VLC was discriminating against the complainant because of her
  identity. '
takeaway: This case is important because it highlights that barring an
  individual's access to a group because of their gender identity constitutes
  discrimination.
