caseName: EN v. Gallagherâ€™s Bar and Lounge
citation: 2021 HRTO 240
description: The applicants are employed by the respondent. They allege that
  they asked the respondent on several occasions to use their correct pronouns,
  to which he refused. The respondent was also heard using slurs towards the
  employees. The OHRT held that the Ontario Human Rights Code was clearly
  violated, and the respondent is liable for compensatory awards.
takeaway: This case, like many others, shows that consistently misusing gender
  pronouns and using slurs, even behind someone's back, is a direct violation of
  the Human Rights Code.
