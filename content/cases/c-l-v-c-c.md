caseName: C(L) v C(C)
citation: 1992 CanLII 7651 (ON SC)
description: Respondent is a woman who passed as a man. Married another woman
  (before sex change completed).  Obtained marriage licence under false
  pretences.
takeaway: One of the applicant's in this case had not undergone gender affirming
  surgery, but identitifed as a man and married a woman. This case is important
  because surgery was still required for legal gender change to take place, and
  as a result, both of the applicants were viewed as women. The marriage was
  nulled because same sex marriage was not legalized (and would continute to be
  illegal until 2005).
