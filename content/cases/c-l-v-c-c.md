caseName: C(L) v C(C)
citation: 1992 CanLII 7651 (ON SC)
description: The issue, in this case, is whether or not the transgender
  applicant's marriage licence was obtained under false pretences. The tribunal
  held that, since the applicant had not undergone surgery, they were still
  legally recognized as female. The marriage was annulled because same-sex
  marriage was not legalized at the time.
takeaway: This case is an example of how marriages were declared invalid if one
  of the individuals was transgender and had not undergone gender-affirming
  surgery. There is added complications due to the fact that same-sex marriage
  was not allowed, and would not be legalized in Canada until 2005.
