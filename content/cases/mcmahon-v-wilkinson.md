caseName: "McMahon v. Wilkinson "
citation: 2015 HRTO 1019
description: The applicants, one of whom is transgender, submit that they were
  subjected to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender
  identity when the respondent did not permit them to rent a unit in the
  respondent's building. The OHRT found that there is sufficient evidence to
  prove that the fact that one of the applicants is transgender was a factor in
  the respondent refusing to rent out a unit to the applicants.
takeaway: "This case is important as it illustrates how refusal to rent out a
  unit to a transgender individual on the basis that they are transgender is
  discrimination under the Code. "
