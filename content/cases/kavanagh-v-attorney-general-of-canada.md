isCornerstone: false
caseName: Kavanagh v. Attorney General of Canada
citation: 2001 CHRT 8486
description: Ms. Kavanagh filed complaints with the Canadian Human Rights
  Commission in relation to the withholding of hormone treatment, the denial of
  sex reassignment surgery and her placement in a male institution. The Tribunal
  held that CSC's Health Service's Policy is discriminatory on the basis of sex
  and disability, and they have not justified a prohibition on access to
  gender-affirming surgery.
takeaway: "Refusal of gender-affirming surgery with no valid justification
  constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex. "
